# Assignment 2: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

# The following functions, makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve, cache the inverse of a given matrix. Instead of recalculating the inverse of a matrix you had already gotten the inverse for, you can just access the result that has been cached, thus making the script for efficient. Note, we are assuming that all matrices used are invertible.


# The makeCacheMatrix function takes in an invertible matrix and creates a matrix that can be cached. Hence, it creates a list of functions (set, get, setinverse, and getinverse) that can be later used to access the inverse of the matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        i <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() i
    list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)

}


# The function cacheSolve takes in the makeCacheMatrix function, inverts the matrix it holds, caches that inverse and returns it. If the makeCacheMatrix function is held within a variable, the first time cacheSolve is run with that variable as its parameter, the inverse of the matrix will be calculated. The second time cacheSolve is ran with that same variable, instead of recalculating the inverse of the matrix, it will access the cached results and return it.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}

# EXAMPLE
# k <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(1:4, 2,2))
# cacheSolve(k) #caches and returns the inverse of the matrix
# cacheSolve(k) #since cacheSolve() was already run once on variable k, it will now return the message "getting cached data" along with the inverse of the matrix, instead of recalculating the inverse
